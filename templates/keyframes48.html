Problem Statement

Martha is interviewing at Subway. One of the rounds of the interview requires her to cut a bread of size l√ób into
smaller identical pieces such that each piece is a square having maximum possible side length with no left over piece of
bread.

Input format
The first line contains an integer T. T lines follow. Each line contains two space separated integers l and b which
denote length and breadth of the bread.

Output format

T lines, each containing an integer that denotes the number of squares of maximum size, when the bread is cut as per
the given condition.
