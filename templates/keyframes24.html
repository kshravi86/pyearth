"""
You are given an array a of size N. The elements of the array are a[0], a[1], ... a[N-1], where each a[i] is either 0 or
 1. You can perform one transformation on the array: choose any two integers L and R, and flip all the elements between
 (and including) the Lth and Rth bits. In other words L and R represent the left-most and the right-most index
 demarcating the boundaries of the segment whose bits you will decided to flip. ('Flipping' a bit means, that a 0 is
 transformed to a 1 and a 1 is transformed to a 0.)

What is the maximum number of '1'-bits (indicated by S) which you can obtain in the final bit-string?
