"""
John has discovered various rocks. Each rock is composed of various elements, and each element is represented by a
lowercase latin letter from 'a' to 'z'. An element can be present multiple times in a rock. An element is called a
'gem-element' if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks.

Given the list of N rocks with their compositions, display the number of gem-elements that exist in those rocks.

Input Format
The first line consists of N, the number of rocks.
Each of the next N lines contain rocks' composition. Each composition consists of lowercase letters of English alphabet.
